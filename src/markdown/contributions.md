CityDesigner.org is meant to be co-created by everyone.

The project has just started, so the site consists mostly of snippets of ideas and everything is done manually for the time being. Please get in touch with me at [ilja@citydesigner.org](mailto:ilja@citydesigner.org) and we can talk about how can you contribute to the project.
